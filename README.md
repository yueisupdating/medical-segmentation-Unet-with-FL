model: I build three models: original Unet model, ResUnet with attention blocks model and transformers Unet model.

Conclusion: 

- Transfomers Unet performs better than other models since its excellent ability in extracting total features of images. 
- FL would break "Data Silo" meanwhile enables model perform better.
